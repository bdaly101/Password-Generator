# Password-Generator

## Description

I made a password generator to practice using JavaScript to achieve a basic task. I built this project to create a program that generates a random password. The user selects a few criteria when they are prompted to do so. The user is asked to select whether or not they want the following characters included in their password: lowercase letters, uppercase  letters, numbers and special characters. The user must select at least one of these categories or they will be shown an error message. Once the user selects the criteria, they are given a randomly generated password using the characters they indicated they wanted to include in the password.
